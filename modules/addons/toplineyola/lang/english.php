It also allows for trial versions to be given to customers by simply registering on your whmcs then ordering a trial sitebuilder.  The trial sitebuilder is stored on your web space you create.  This addon module does not currently do anything it just made the installation portion much easier.  You can now create a Topline Yola server in WHMCS like you would a cPanel server.  Once you&#39;ve done this start creating products in your WHMCS.  Once you&#39;ve completed this you now will use the bundle option in WHMCS to bundle your Yola sitebuilder with a hosting package.";
